## The Case
Using the API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

We want to see the following:
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) in a given dimension
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) at a given location
- Show all characters that partake in a given episode
- Showing all information of a character (Name, species, gender, last location, dimension, etc)

## How?
How do we want you to do it? We don't care, make it in React, Vue, Symfony, Zend, Slim, etc... 
Make it in the framework(s) of your choice. Just make sure you do it in a language that applies to the position you're applying for. (PHP for Backend-dev, Javascript for frontend-dev)
Just make sure it is something you're proud of and shows us your knowledge and abilities!

## Bonus points
Want to impress us a bit more? Here are some tips to do so
- Dockerize it
- Use awesome techniques
- Make it (the code) look pretty
- Integrate 1 or more extra API's in a creative way
- Explain to us in detail how a plumbus is made (yes, this is real)
