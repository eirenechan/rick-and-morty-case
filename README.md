## The Case
Using the API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

We want to see the following:
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) in a given dimension
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) at a given location
- Show all characters that partake in a given episode
- Showing all information of a character (Name, species, gender, last location, dimension, etc)

## How?
How do we want you to do it? 

If you are applying as a front-end developer, make use of the following:
* NextJS
* styled-components
* Apollo GraphQL

If you are applying as a back-end developer:
Make it in the framework(s) of your choice. Just make sure you do it in PHP.

Make sure it is something you're proud of and shows us your knowledge and abilities!

## Bonus points
Want to impress us a bit more? Here are some tips to do so
- Dockerize it
- Use awesome techniques
- Make it (the code) look pretty
- Integrate 1 or more extra API's in a creative way
- Explain to us in detail how a plumbus is made (yes, this is real)
